            "ingredients" : [ "2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, or 1 tablespoon each ½ cup minced onion salt, generous pinch 2 large garlic cloves, minced 1½ cups arborio rice 2 quarts well-seasoned chicken or vegetable stock, as needed ½ cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc ¼ to ½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese (1 to 2 ounces) put your stock or broth into a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over low heat, with a ladle nearby or in the pot. (make sure your stock is well-seasoned.) directions heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat in a wide, heavy saucepan or skillet. add the onion and a generous pinch of salt, and cook gently until just tender, about 3 minutes. do not brown. add the rice and the garlic and stir until the grains separate and begin to crackle. add the wine and stir until it has evaporated and been absorbed by the rice. begin adding the simmering stock, a couple of ladlefuls (about ½ cup) at a time. the stock should just cover the rice, and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. cook, stirring often, until it is just about absorbed. add another ladleful or two of the stock and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock and stirring when the rice is almost dry. you do not have to stir constantly (as i was told to do when i started making risotto), but stir often to enable the rice to release its starch. when the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, in 20 to 25 minutes, it is done. taste now and adjust seasoning. add another ladleful or two of stock to the rice. stir in the parmesan and remove from the heat. the mixture should be creamy (add more stock if it isn’t). serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates, spreading the risotto in a thin layer rather than piling it into a mound. advance preparation: you can begin up to several hours before serving: begin the recipe and cook halfway through step 3, that is, for about 15 minutes. the rice should still be hard when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. spread it in an even layer in the pan and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. if the pan is not wide enough for you to spread the rice in a thin layer, transfer it to a sheet pan. about 15 minutes before serving, bring the remaining stock back to a simmer and reheat the rice. resume cooking as instructed. risotto with fresh herbs use the template for basic risotto and include the garlic, adding one or two additional cloves if desired. chop 1 to 2 cups fresh herbs (to taste), such as parsley, tarragon, chives. finely chop 2 teaspoons lemon zest and squeeze the juice from 1/2 lemon. at the end of cooking, when you stir in your last addition of stock, stir in the herbs, lemon zest and lemon juice and proceed with the recipe. mushroom risotto ingredients 1 ounce (about 1 heaped cup) dried mushrooms, preferably porcinis 1 quart chicken or vegetable stock 1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional) salt to taste 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, or 1 tablespoon each ½ cup minced onion 1 pound fresh cultivated or wild mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and cut in thick slices 2 large garlic cloves, minced ½ to 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or ¼ to ½ teaspoon dried thyme, to taste 1½ cups arborio rice ½ cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley 1 to 2 ounces parmesan cheese, grated (¼ to ½ cup) freshly ground pepper directions place the dried mushrooms in a bowl or in a large pyrex measuring cup and pour in 3 cups boiling-hot water. let sit for 30 minutes. line a strainer with cheesecloth or with a double thickness of paper towels, place it over a bowl and drain the mushrooms. squeeze the mushrooms over the strainer to extract all the liquid, then rinse them in several changes of water to remove sand. chop coarsely and set aside. combine the mushroom soaking liquid with enough stock to make 7 cups. add the soy sauce and salt to taste. transfer to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. heat one tablespoon of the oil or butter over medium heat in a large nonstick frying pan and add the onion. cook, stirring, until the onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes, and add the dried and fresh mushrooms. cook, stirring, until the mushrooms begin to release liquid. add the garlic and thyme. cook, stirring, until the mushroom liquid has just about evaporated, and add the remaining oil and the rice. cook, stirring, until the grains of rice are separate and beginning to crackle. add the wine and stir until it has evaporated and been absorbed by the rice. begin adding the simmering stock, a couple of ladlefuls (about ½ cup) at a time. the stock should just cover the rice, and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. cook, stirring often, until it is just about absorbed. add another ladleful or two of the stock and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock and stirring when the rice is almost dry. you do not have to stir constantly, but stir often to enable the rice to release its starch. when the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, in 20 to 25 minutes, it is done. taste now and adjust seasoning. add another ladleful or two of stock to the rice. stir in the parsley and parmesan and remove from the heat. the mixture should be creamy (add more stock if it isn’t). serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates, spreading the risotto in a thin layer rather than piling it into a mound. zester daily contributor martha rose shulman is the award-winning author of more than 25 cookbooks. her latest is “the very best of recipes

Turn a burner to medium-high heat and set your pepper directly above the flame on the grate. Use a pair of tongs to turn the peppers often until the skin is completely blackened. Flip often to prevent too much char/burning. Place the peppers in a heat-proof mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap or foil. Allow it to steam, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap/foil and then begin to remove the skin from the peppers. You can do this with a paper towel or under running water. Try your best, it is okay if there are still little bits left. Cut the top off of the pepper and remove the seeds. Dice the peppers and set them aside.

Place a lid on the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium and let boil for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fully cooked and easily pierced with a fork. Drain the hot water from the potatoes, mash them until smooth, and set aside.", "While the potatoes are cooking, start the curry tomato cream sauce.

If you are using fenugreek seeds instead of kasoori methi, also add the fenugreek seeds at this point. Cover the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer covered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.", "Transfer the onion and tomato mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, making sure to vent so hot air doesn't build up in the blender. Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender, but the final sauce will not be as silky smooth. Pour the creamy mixture back into the pot and add the coconut milk, reserving ~1/4 cup back to serve and crush the methi in your fingers and add to the pot. Mix together and cover the pot and set aside until the kofta are ready.", "In a large mixing bowl, mash the tofu by squeezing it in your hands until it's creamy and no chunks remain. You want to have the texture of ricotta. Alternatively you can blend it in a small food processor until smooth.", "Add the mashed potatoes to the mashed tofu along with the corn starch, minced cilantro, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt. Mix together and test the consistency by forming some into a ball. It should hold together. It can stick to your hands a little, but if it is very sticky or too wet and falling apart, you can add a bit more corn starch. This can vary depending on what brand and variety of tofu you use, but the recipe is quite flexible. Mix in the frozen peas. Shape the kofta mixture into heaping 1 tablespoon portions and roll into balls or into a football shape (a torpedo).", "To fry the kofta: Heat about 2-inches of high heat safe oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Test the oil either with a thermometer until it is 325-350 ºF or you can test with a small piece of the kofta mixture: the oil should bubble/boil vigorously around it and the kofta should float to the surface fairly quickly after being dropped in. When the oil is heated fry the shaped kofta in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, until the kofta is a beautiful dark golden brown color, flipping halfway through for even cooking. This should take 5-10 minutes, depending on the temperature of your oil, how much oil you have heated (more oil means the temperature is more stable when you add the kofta), and how many kofta you add at once. When the kofta are cooked, transfer to a paper towel lined plate with a wire spider strainer. Repeat with remaining batched of kofta until all are cooked.", "To bake the kofta: Preheat the oven to 425 ºF. Line a baking tray with parchement and spray or brush with oil. Arrange the shaped kofta onto the baking tray so there is 1/2-1\" between each kofta. Spray or brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, flipping after the first 15-20 minutes, until both sides are golden and the edges of the kofta are crispy and chewy. It's normal for the kofta to lose their shape a little and flatten when baked.", "When ready to serve, pour the sauce overtop the kofta (only use what you will eat in one sitting, as the kofta get soggy once in the sauce), then pour the reserved coconut milk over top the kofta. Garnish with cilantro if desired. Enjoy with Indian flatbread and/or basmati rice." ],

Turn a burner to medium-high heat and set your pepper directly above the flame on the grate. Use a pair of tongs to turn the peppers often until the skin is completely blackened. Flip often to prevent too much char/burning. Place the peppers in a heat-proof mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap or foil. Allow it to steam, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap/foil and then begin to remove the skin from the peppers. You can do this with a paper towel or under running water. Try your best, it is okay if there are still little bits left. Cut the top off of the pepper and remove the seeds. Dice the peppers and set them aside.
